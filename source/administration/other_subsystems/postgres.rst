Postgres Backend
================

The Postgres backend was introduced in Megam 0.2 as an alternative to the Sqlite backend available in previous releases.

Either of them can be used seamlessly to the upper layers and ecosystem tools. These high level components do not need to be modified or configured.

The two backends cannot coexist, and you will have to decide which one is going to be used while planning your Megam installation.
