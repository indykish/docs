Users & Groups Overview
========================

Megam includes a complete user & group management system. Users in an Megam installation are classified in two types:

-  **Administrators**, an admin user belongs to an admin group and can perform manage operations
-  **Regular users**, that may access most Megam functionality.


Please proceed to the following guides to learn more:

-  :ref:`Managing Users <manage_users>`

By default, the authentication and authorization is handled by the Megam Core as described above.
