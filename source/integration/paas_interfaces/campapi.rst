Megam CAMP Specification
==============================

Overview
========

The Megam CAMP API is a RESTful service to create, control and manage cloud application and services using an implementation of the `OASIS CAMP API specification <http://www.oasis.org>`__ based on the `public draft 02 <http://docs.oasis-open.org/camp/camp-spec/v1.1/camp-spec-v1.1.html>`__. This implementation also includes some extensions. 

The purpose of the API to manage the building, running, administration, monitoring and patching of applications/services in the cloud. Its purpose is to enable interoperability among self-service interfaces to PaaS clouds by defining artifacts and formats that can be used with any conforming cloud and enable independent vendors to create tools and services that interact with any conforming cloud using the defined interfaces.
