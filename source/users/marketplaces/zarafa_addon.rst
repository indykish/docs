This allows you to consume pre built ``zarafa collaboration platform <https://community.zarafa.com/>`` application and services from 3rd party in a single click.

Overview
------------------

The Zarafa Collaboration Platform (ZCP) combines the usability of Outlook with the stability and flexibility of a Linux server. It features a rich web-interface, the Zarafa WebAccess, and provides brilliant integration options with all sorts of clients including all most popular mobile platforms.
Most components of ZCP are open source, licensed under the AGPLv3, can therefore be downloaded freely as ZCP's Community Edition.

Several closed source components exist, most notably:

- ``the Zarafa Windows Client`` providing Outlook integration,
- ``the Zarafa BES Integration`` providing Blackberry Enterprise Server connectivity,
- ``the Zarafa ADS Plugin`` providing Active Directory integration, and the Zarafa Backup Tools.

These components, together with several advanced features for large setups and hosters, are only available in combination with a support contract as part of ZCP's Commercial Editions.

The community version provides a Zarafa Collboration Platform with Webaccess.
