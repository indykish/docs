Understanding Megam DSL
================================================================================


A domain-specific language (DSL) is a computer language specialized to a particular application domain. This is in contrast to a general-purpose language, which is broadly applicable across domains, and lacks specialized features for a particular domain. There are a wide variety of DSLs, ranging from widely used languages for common domains, such as HTML for web pages, down to languages used by only a single piece of software.

DSL (Domain Specific Language)
--------------------------------

This guide is meant for the cloud architect and administrator, to help him to understand the way Megam DSL operates in the infrastructure resources, and how they are consumed by the users.

The Megam DSL incorporating some related work/concepts from elsewhere, including `TOSCA <http://bit.ly/1sXfsIV>`_. These specs are both evolving and there is scope for them to converge to something simple, intuitive, and powerful: this is an aim towards that convergence, and is believed to map nicely on to all three (Megam, TOSCA, and CAMP), and make it easy to represent other popular tools and techniques (e.g. Chef, SaltStack).
