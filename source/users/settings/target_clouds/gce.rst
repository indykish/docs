    Choose ``GCE`` icon.



OAuth : GCE
    We use OAuth to authenticate with google. So for GCE, you need to `Login with Google` first before proceeding.

    A popup appears asking to enter your GCE Credentials.  If you don't have one you can create the same in Google compute website.


Select Parameters
    Your gce paramters should be listed. We are working to update public images that we support in megam in google.

    Choose the group, flavor, and other details you want to use and save the setting.

    For gce we have building pre-built public partner images. Hence you will not find an exhaustive list of your images.

    Save the configuration.



List Settings
    The list of your saved settings are shown here.
