Quickstart: Introduction to Services
==========================================

Services can be attached or not to an application. It could be a database, a cache system or a search engine.

Services are internal and provided by external partners. They all run on Megam core architecture.

Currently **available services** are listed below: 

-  ``Wordpress``
-  ``Redis``
-  ``PostgreSQL``
-  ``Riak``
-  ``Zarafa``
-  ``Op5``
-  ``Backup``
-  ``High Availability using DRBD``
-  ``Jenkins``
-  ``SCM-Manager``

More will come pretty soon.

Services can run alone or not. It means that you can use Megam for just a service, or attach a service to an existing Megam application. It implies that in Megam dashboard, services management is outside application management. 

.. warning: You can add tags to any service in order to quickly find them in the future.
