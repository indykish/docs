==========

Megam 0.5 introduces important improvements in several areas.  We are excited to annouce ``Cloud In a Box`` which helps to setup **private cloud** and **Megam** in your own datacenter real quick and no hassle way.

The target cloud support has taken a spin to support private cloud (OpenNebula) which means now you can launch apps/services inside your datacenter.

Megam has started a journey to deliver a more intuitive and simpler provisioning experience for users using  `CAMP <http://http://docs.oasis-open.org/camp/camp-spec/v1.1/camp-spec-v1.1.html>`__ and `TOSCA <http://docs.oasis-open.org/tosca/TOSCA-Simple-Profile-YAML/v1.0/TOSCA-Simple-Profile-YAML-v1.0.html>`__.
