"Megam Cloud" uses any public git repo or your private git repo to launch the apps/services in the cloud. 


Some of the popular ones are described here. There are two choices for providing a Git repo. You can ``manually`` type the repo url
or ``authenticate to the scm`` and we use the api to list your repos.
