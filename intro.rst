**Fast Provisioning Using Chef 11**
  The nodes are provisioned using Chef 11, which makes it powerful and extendable cloud automation with benefits.  
  Chef Recipes are blueprints that tell Megam all the details needed to run an application – which middleware services to run, 
  what the dependencies are between the services, how to install the services, where to find the application and service binaries, 
  when to spawn more instances or terminate existing ones, and even how to monitor each of the services. 
  Recipes are the mechanism that enables deployment of any middleware stack, using any data store (relational or non-relational), to any cloud. 
  

**Marketplace**
  A single click launch of pre-built popular apps like wordpress and more.
  
**Real-time Log & Offline**
