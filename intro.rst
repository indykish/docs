**Fast Provisioning Using Chef 11**
  The apps/services are provisioned using Chef 11, which makes it powerful and extendable cloud automation with benefits.  
  Chef Recipes are blueprints that tell Megam all the details needed to run an application – which middleware services to run, 
  what the dependencies are between the services, how to install the services, where to find the application and service binaries, 
  when to spawn more instances or terminate existing ones, and even how to monitor each of the services. 
    

**Marketplace**
  A single click launch of pre-built popular apps like Wordpress, PostgreSQL, Riak, Redis, Jenkins, SCM-Manager and more to come.

**Disaster Recovery**
  Build highly available apps on any cloud using `DRBD <http://www.drbd.org>`. 
  
**Real-time Log & Offline**
  You will be able to stream logs, and do analytics on the offline logs. 

**Metering Monitoring**
  You will be able to monitor and meter the servers for free.
